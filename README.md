Hi, I'm Mohamed 👋

I'm the founder of **[Cronacl](https://cronacl.com)** and **[Galvn](https://galvn.com)**.

Cronacl is an AI workspace that maintains context across conversations, executes multi-step workflows through specialized agents, and integrates with existing tools. It's designed for teams that need intelligence without the overhead of traditional AI implementations.

Galvn builds custom AI systems for businesses. We focus on production-grade agent architectures, knowledge retrieval systems, and tool integration that starts working immediately. No extended rollouts or consultant lock-in.

I'm a software engineer and technical consultant, working on backend systems, full-stack applications, and infrastructure for clients across multiple industries. I specialize in TypeScript and Rust, contribute to open source projects like Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and prioritize performance and maintainability in everything I build.

I created **[lla](https://github.com/chaqchase/lla)**, the best and most feature-rich open source ls replacement written in Rust, featuring Git integration, plugin extensibility, and advanced search capabilities. I also built **[Da.Synth](https://dasynth.chaqchase.com)**, a web-based audio synthesizer for rapid sound design prototyping.
