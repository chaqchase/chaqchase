Hi, I'm Mohamed 👋

I'm the founder of [Fidelect](https://fidelect.com) and [Galvn](https://galvn.com). Previously built [Cronacl](https://cronacl.com), an AI-native execution workspace.

[Fidelect](https://fidelect.com) is a modern Business OS for customer-centric brands. It unifies loyalty, CRM, campaigns, rewards, referrals, scheduling, analytics, and AI-powered support into one coherent system. Built for retail, clinics, beauty, gyms, and hybrid businesses that want measurable growth and deeper customer relationships. Not just loyalty software. A true operating system for physical and hybrid businesses.

[Galvn](https://galvn.com) builds production-grade AI systems for businesses. We design agent architectures, knowledge retrieval systems, and tool integrations that deliver value immediately. Focused execution, real systems, no consultant lock-in.

[Cronacl](https://cronacl.com) was an AI-native workspace designed for structured execution. It maintained context across conversations, executed multi-step workflows through specialized agents, and integrated deeply with external tools. The infrastructure and agent architecture developed there directly influence Fidelect today.

I'm a software engineer and technical consultant working across backend systems, full-stack applications, and infrastructure. I specialize in TypeScript and Rust, contribute to open source projects like Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and prioritize performance, clarity, and maintainability in everything I build.

I created [lla](https://github.com/chaqchase/lla), a blazing fast open source ls replacement written in Rust with Git integration, plugin extensibility, and advanced search capabilities.
